# .rice — Toxic

Black & toxic-waste-green theme. Each app folder holds a theme file that gets
included/imported from the app's real config, so the palette lives in one
place.

## Apps

- `ghostty/` — terminal, included via `config-file = ?~/.rice/ghostty/theme.conf`
- `sway/` — window border colors, included via `include ~/.rice/sway/theme.conf`
  (the status bar itself is waybar now, not swaybar — see `waybar/` below)
- `waybar/` — `style.css` imported via `@import` from `~/.config/waybar/style.css`
  (functional config lives in `~/.dots/waybar`; swapped in for swaybar since
  swaybar can't center a module or lay out network/battery)
- `yazi/` — `theme.toml` (TOML has no include directive, so this file *is*
  the config): `~/.dots/yazi/.config/yazi/theme.toml` is a relative symlink
  straight to it, stowed to `~/.config/yazi/theme.toml`. Themes UI chrome and
  the broad filetype mime groups; leaves the per-extension icon/brand-color
  tables alone, same call as nvim's syntax highlighting
- `wofi/` — launcher, imported via `@import` from `~/.config/wofi/style.css`
- `tmux/` — status bar / panes / messages, sourced via `source-file ~/.rice/tmux/theme.conf`
  from `~/.dots/tmux/.config/tmux/tmux.conf`
- `nvim/` — editor chrome only (statusline, splits, popups, gutter, signs —
  never Comment/String/Function/`@`-treesitter groups), loaded via
  `dofile(vim.fn.expand("~/.rice/nvim/theme.lua"))` from
  `~/.dots/nvim/.config/nvim/lua/config/theme.lua`
- `fish/` — prompt color (`rice_color_dir`), sourced via the existing
  `~/.dots/fish/.config/fish/conf.d/00-rice.fish` hook
- `eza/` — `theme.yml` (perms, size, users, git, file types, ...) pointed at
  via `EZA_CONFIG_DIR`, plus a small `EZA_COLORS` override for the ten
  classic file-kind codes (di/ln/ex/...) that `LS_COLORS` would otherwise
  clobber — both set from `~/.rice/eza/colors.fish`, sourced by
  `00-rice.fish`
- `fzf/` — `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS` (fzf.fish's base options + `--color`), sourced
  from `00-rice.fish` before fzf.fish's own wrapper would otherwise set its
  defaults
